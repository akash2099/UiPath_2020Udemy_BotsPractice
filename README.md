# UiPath_2020Udemy_BotsPractice

The purpose of providing you with these robots is so that you can see the details of how the workflows and activities were set up.

If you copy-paste these robots onto your machine, and try run them, some of these robots won't run without errors. This is because the selectors defined when building these robots were on my machine (computer). You will have to redefine these selectors on your machine so that the robots run without any errors. How to define selectors is covered extensively through the course lectures.

Enjoy the course!

This bots are for practice purposes, from Complete UiPath RPA Developer Course Build 7 Robots course, by Leon Petrou.
